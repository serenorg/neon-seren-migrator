          ## ✨ Minor Release: v2.3.0

          This release adds verbose progress output to all dump and restore operations, providing real-time feedback during long-running replication tasks.

          ### 🎯 New Features

          **Verbose Progress Output for All Operations**
          - Added `--verbose` flag to `pg_dumpall` for global object dump progress
          - Added `--verbose` flag to `pg_dump` for schema and data dump progress
          - Added `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` to `psql` commands for better error visibility
          - `pg_restore` already had verbose output enabled

          ### Why This Matters

          Previously, users experienced silent periods during dump and restore operations, making it unclear if the tool was working or stuck. This was especially problematic during:
          - Large database dumps that could take minutes or hours
          - Multi-table operations where progress wasn't visible
          - Operations on macOS and other platforms where native progress wasn't showing

          Now users see real-time output like:
          ```
          pg_dump: reading schemas
          pg_dump: reading user-defined tables
          pg_dump: dumping contents of table "public"."users"
          pg_dump: dumping contents of table "public"."orders"
          pg_restore: processing data for table "public"."users"
          pg_restore: processing data for table "public"."orders"
          ```

          ### Benefits

          - **Transparency**: See exactly which tables are being processed in real-time
          - **Confidence**: Know the tool is actively working, not stuck or frozen
          - **Debugging**: Identify slow tables or operations immediately
          - **Better UX**: No more wondering if the process has stalled during long operations

          ### Installation

          Download the appropriate binary for your platform:

          - **Linux (x64)**: `postgres-seren-replicator-linux-x64-binary`
          - **macOS (Intel)**: `postgres-seren-replicator-macos-x64-binary`
          - **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `postgres-seren-replicator-macos-arm64-binary`

          Make the binary executable:

          ```bash
          chmod +x postgres-seren-replicator-*-binary
          ./postgres-seren-replicator-*-binary --help
          ```

          ### Upgrade Recommendation

          Recommended for all users. This release significantly improves the user experience during replication operations by providing clear, real-time progress feedback.
